## Short Bio

I am a [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) student in Mathematical Statistics at University of Cambridge. My research interests lie in Monte Carlo methods, Gaussian Process and change-point detection. I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) at Imperial College London in 2019. Prior to my undergraduate, I studied A Levels and GCSEs at [Beijing New Talent Academy](http://www.bjnewtalent.com/jianqiao/) in Beijing, China.

In summer 2019, I was a summer research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. Specifically, I worked on training NLP models on medical records provided by the SickKids Hospital in order to identify Sepsis at an early stage, thereby allowing prompt treatment. This research was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and was supported by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found on their website. 


## Imperial Maths Competition
I am a co-founder of the [Imperial Maths Competition](https://icmathscomp.org/index.html). This is a student-led Maths challenge co-hosted by the [Imperial College MathSoc](https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcsu/mathsoc/about19-20) and Maths societies in many other UK universities. Beginning from Autumn 2017, this competition aims to provide a platform for all UK undergraduates/Master's students with an opportunity to enjoy Olympiad-like Mathematics. The 2019-2020 Individual Compeition will take place on 24th of November and is now accepting [sign-ups](https://icmathscomp.org/signup/). Please visit the website for more information.
